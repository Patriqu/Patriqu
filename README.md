### About Me
Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Engineer with 6 years of commercial experience in writing backend web applications in Java and also in plain JavaScript & jQuery on frontend. I also have experience in Python, C++, and C# programs.

âš¡Projects in progress:
- Music portals aggregator (Kotlin, Spring Boot)
- DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) - in progress, to be uploaded on GitHub
- Memo Game - written in Kotlin and libGDX game development framework
- Arkanoid 2D - written in C++, SDL 2.0 library, bug fixing, refactoring, and improving.
