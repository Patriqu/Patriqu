### About Me
Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Engineer with 6 years of commercial experience in writing backend web applications in Java and also in plain JavaScript & jQuery on frontend. I also have experience in Python, C++, and C# programs.
I'm currently working in the company as a Fullstack Software developer with Java, JavaEE, Wildfly, Spring Boot 3, and JS/TS, HTML, CSS, and Angular 17 stack.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my knowledge of Spring Boot, Spring Cloud platforms, microservices architecture, cloud concepts, frontend frameworks like Angular/Vue/React, and writing my own applications using different programming languages like Java, Kotlin, Golang, TS/JS and C++.
